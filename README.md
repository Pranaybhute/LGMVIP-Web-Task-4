# Basic Calculator

This is a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculation. The calculator features a clean interface and real-time input display, allowing users to see the full expression as they type.

## Features

- Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), and Division (`/`)
- Percentage calculation (`%`)
- Clear (`C`) and Delete (`Del`) functionality
- Real-time expression display
- Responsive design with CSS grid system for layout

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the calculator interface.
- **CSS**: To style the calculator and provide layout via the CSS grid.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the calculator logic, including user input, calculations, and display updates.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Numbers and operators are clicked to form an expression. The full expression (like `10+9`) is displayed in real-time.
2. **Calculate**: When the `=` button is pressed, the calculator evaluates the expression using JavaScript's `eval()` function.
3. **Percentage**: The `%` button divides the current number by 100.
4. **Clear**: The `C` button clears the display and resets all values.
5. **Delete**: The `Del` button removes the last digit of the current number.

## Code Structure

- **HTML**: Basic structure with buttons for numbers, operators, and a display area.
- **CSS**: Provides styling and layout using CSS Grid.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for calculations and input handling.
